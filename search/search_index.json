We provide a step-by-step set of instructions for participants on how to install all of the required software for the course. Our instructions provide details for Windows, Mac and Ubuntu flavoured Linux machines. We use these instructions ourselves when setting up our machines. Let us know if you find the instructions useful for your own work. If you find errors or explanations that lack clarity, drop us a short email (see Contact page) or post an issue on the respective Github pages listed below and we'll do our best to add some clarifiying information. Current Installation Guides The Installation Guide for the 4 day \"Foundations\" Course is available here . Installation Issues - tells us about them . The Installation Guide for the 3 week course typically held in Summer is here . Installation Issues - tells us about them . Archived Installation Guides We archive older versions of the installation guide so that participants in previous editions have access to how to set up the environment they used during the course. The 2018 Installation Guide is here The 2017 Installation Guide is here . We recommend that 2016 participants use this version.

Unfortunately, it is rare that they have been taught how to do this well. Exposure to programming languages in the current graduate curriculum is most often limited to the simple use of Stata and Matlab to solve `toy' examples designed to illustrate a theoretical result or implement a method with known properties and ex-ante known results. These skills do not scale up in a straightforward manner to handle complex projects that make up research papers, PhD theses or typical work in government or private business settings. As a result, graduate researchers in economics and business spend too much time wrestling with the software required to produce their research. This course is designed to assist graduate and early career researchers become more fluent in conducting computational research. It is aimed at PhD students who expect to write their theses in a field that requires modest to heavy use of computation. Examples include applied microeconomics, econometrics, macroeconomics, computational economics. We introduce students to programming methods that will substantially reduce their time spent programming while at the same time making their programs more dependable and their results reproducible. The course draws extensively on some simple techniques that are the backbone of modern software development which most economists are simply not aware of. It shows the usefulness of these techniques by means of hands-on examples for a wide variety of economic and econometric applications. Target Audience This course is intended for PhD students who are transitioning from coursework to research. Next to your economics background, we will only assume that you have written small pieces of code before, like Stata .do-files or Matlab .m-files for problem sets in your Masters degree or first-year PhD classes. Knowledge of a specific programming language is not required. A large part of this course is really about tool choice. We will take care in pointing out which language is most appropriate for which problem, and provide you with introductions to three popular choices for data- and computationally intensive computing. These are not the only choices available but some knowledge of these languages will make picking up others on your own or through our PhD computing seminars relatively easy. Course Objectives This course has two closely intertwined objectives: Enhancing students' programming efficiency. Providing the tools to make data analysis and computation reproducible.","title":"Motivation"},{"location":"about/about-us/#motivation","text":"Much of modern economics and business research involves the researcher spending their lives in front of a computer -- analysing data or simulating theoretical models.
