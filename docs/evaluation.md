# Evaluation

!!! Note "Submission Deadline"
    Submissions must be made by 8.9.2024 at 23:59.

This course will be assessed on a pass/fail basis, with a final assignment accounting for 100% of the evaluation. The assignment, which must apply the tools and techniques learned during the course, is due one week after the course concludes. Detailed instructions will be provided in the first class.

Students may work individually or in pairs. The assignment must be managed using Git and hosted on GitHub. The final evaluation will be based on the submitted GitHub repository. The entire project should be executable with a single command, which will automate all steps, from data acquisition to the generation of a final report.
